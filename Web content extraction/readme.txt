Web content extraction is a key technology for enabling an array of applications aimed at understanding the web.
This project aims to extract less structured web content, like news articles, that appear only once in noisy webpages.


The goal of this project is to develop new technique for content extraction using supervised machine learning algorithms based on a sample of web pages with manually labelled contents; that is, the contents of these web pages have been identified as main or noisy by a human annotator. In addition, the content extraction performance under these rules should be evaluated.
